      Iâ€™m a driven software engineer who is passionate about transforming ideas
      into dynamic full stack applications that can solve real-world problems. I
      place a large emphasis on creating rich and robust interfaces that are
      seamless and intuitive to users. I thrive in team-oriented environments
      that value effective communication and transparency.

      I'm a huge advocate
      of blockchain technology, especially Ethereum, and believe it will lead to
      a new wave of disruptive applications that are secure and immutable.
